# Problem 64

To draw a tree a layout algorithm determines the position of each node in a rectangular grid. Several layout methods are conceivable, one of them is illustrated below:

![](../i/p64.gif)

In this layout strategy, the following two rules determine the position:
* ```x(v)``` is equal to the position of the node ```v``` in the inorder sequence
* ```y(v)``` is equal to the depth of the node ```v``` in the tree. 

Write a function to annotate each node of the tree with its position. 

##Example
```elm 
import Html exposing (text)

type Tree a
    = Empty
    | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

tree64 = 
  Tree 'n'
    (Tree 'k'
      (Tree 'c'
        (Tree 'a' Empty Empty)
        (Tree 'h'
          (Tree 'g'
            (Tree 'e' Empty Empty)
            Empty)
          Empty))
      (Tree 'm' Empty Empty))
    (Tree 'u'
      (Tree 'p'
        Empty
          (Tree 's'
            (Tree 'q' Empty Empty)
            Empty))
      Empty)
                
layoutTree : Tree a -> Tree (a, (Int, Int)) 
layoutTree tree = 
-- your implementation goes here

layout tree64 ==  
  Node ('n',(8,1)) (Node ('k',(6,2)) (Node ('c',(2,3)) ...

```
