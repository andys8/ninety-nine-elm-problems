# Problem 26
Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list

In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure mathematicians, this result may be great, but we want to really generate all the possibilities in a list.

```
combinations 3 [1..12]
```

Result:

``` 
[[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,2,5], ... ]
```

## Unit Test
```
import Html
import List

combinations : Int -> List a -> List (List a) 
combinations n list =
    if n == 0 then
        [[]]
    else
        case list of
            [] ->
                []
                
            (x::xs) ->
                --(List.filter (\l -> (List.length l) == n) (List.map ((::)x) (tails list))) 
                (List.filter (\l -> (List.length l) == n) 
                    ((List.map (List.take n) 
                        (List.map ((::)x) (tails list)))))
                ++ (combinations n xs) 


-- hint
tails : List a -> List (List a)
tails xs =
  case xs of
    [] ->
      []
      
    y::ys -> ys :: tails ys    
        

main = Html.text <| toString <| combinations 3 [1..5]
main' =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )


test : Bool
test =
    List.all ((==) True)
        [ combinations 1 [1..5] == [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
        , combinations 2 [1..3] == [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
        , combinations 2 [1..4] == [[1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]]
        , combinations 0 [1..5] == []
        , combinations -1 [1..5] == []
        ]
        && List.all ((==) True)
            [ List.length (combinations 3 [1..12]) == 220
            , List.length (combinations 4 [1..15]) == 1365
            ]


```

## Hints
1. The function ```List.Extra.tails``` could be helpful. How would you use a function that takes a list and returns a iterated list of its tails?

```
tails [1, 2, 3, 4] == [[2,3,4],[3,4],[4],[]]
```
