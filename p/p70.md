# Problem 70

A multiway tree has a root element and a set of successors which are multiway trees themselves. A multiway tree is never empty, although it's list of children may be an empty list. 

Define type to a represent multiway trees, Create a tree instance to represent the tree in the diagram below. Write a function to count all nodes of the tree.

##Example

```elm
type MTree a = MNode a (List (MNode a))

mtree = MNode 'a' 
          [ MNode 'f' [ MNode 'g' [] ]
          , MNode 'c'
          , MNode 'b' [ MNode 'd' MNode 'e'] ]
          ]
count 
```
