# Problem 55

In a balanced binary tree the difference between the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees is less than one.

Write a function to construct a balanced binary tree for a given number of nodes. Put the letter 'x' as data value for all nodes of the tree.

## Example
```elm
type Tree a
    = Empty
    | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

balancedTree 4 == 
  Node '1' 
    (Node '2' 
        (Node '4' (Empty) (Empty)) (Empty)) 
    (Node '3' (Empty) (Empty))  

```

##Unit Test
```elm
import Html exposing (text)

balancedTree : Int -> Tree Char 
balancedTree n = 
-- your implementation goes here

main = 
  text 
  <| toString 
  <| balancedTree 11   
  
```
