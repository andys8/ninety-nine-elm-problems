# Problem 80

A graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges, where each edge is a pair of nodes. Throughout these problems we will represent nodes with single characters.

There are several ways to represent graphs. One method is to represent each edge separately.

```elm
type Edges a = List((a,a))
edges80 = [ ('b','c'), ('b','f'), ('c','f'), ('f','k'), ('g','h')]
```

We call this edge-clause form. The edge-clause cannot represent isolated nodes. To represent the whole graph we can use as a pair of sets (nodes and edges).

```elm
type Graph a = (List(a), Edges a)
graph80 = ( [ 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'k' ],
  [ ('b','c'), ('b','f'), ('c','f'), ('f','k'), ('g','h') ] )
```
We call this graph-term form. Note, that the lists are kept sorted, they are really sets, without duplicated elements. Each edge appears only once in the edge list; i.e. an edge ```('x','y')``` represents one edge between x and y. The term ```('y','x')``` is not shown. The graph-term form is our default representation. 

A third representation method is to associate with each node the set of nodes that are adjacent to that node. We call this the adjacency-list form. In our example:

```elm
type AdjList a = List((a, List a))
adjList80 = 
[ ('b',['c','f']), 
  ('c',['b','f']), 
  ('d',[]), 
  ('f',['b','c','k']), 
  ('k',['f']), 
  ('h',['g'])
]
```

Typing the terms by hand is cumbersome and error-prone. We can define a more compact and "human-friendly" notation as follows: A graph is represented by a list of atoms and terms of the type X-Y (i.e. functor '-' and arity 2). The atoms stand for isolated nodes, the X-Y terms describe edges. If an X appears as an endpoint of an edge, it is automatically defined as a node. Our example could be written as:

[b-c, f-c, g-h, d, f-b, k-f, h-g]
We call this the human-friendly form. As the example shows, the list does not have to be sorted and may even contain the same edge multiple times. Notice the isolated node d. (Actually, isolated nodes do not even have to be atoms in the Prolog sense, they can be compound terms, as in d(3.75,blue) instead of d in the example).

When the edges are directed we call them arcs. These are represented by ordered pairs. Such a graph is called directed graph. To represent a directed graph, the forms discussed above are slightly modified. The example graph above is represented as follows:

Arc-clause form

arc(s,u).
arc(u,r).
...
Graph-term form

digraph([r,s,t,u,v],[a(s,r),a(s,u),a(u,r),a(u,s),a(v,u)])
Adjacency-list form

[n(r,[]),n(s,[r,u]),n(t,[]),n(u,[r]),n(v,[u])]
Note that the adjacency-list does not have the information on whether it is a graph or a digraph.

Human-friendly form

[s > r, t, u > r, s > u, u > s, v > u] 
Finally, graphs and digraphs may have additional information attached to nodes and edges (arcs). For the nodes, this is no problem, as we can easily replace the single character identifiers with arbitrary compound terms, such as city('London',4711). On the other hand, for edges we have to extend our notation. Graphs with additional information attached to edges are called labelled graphs.

Arc-clause form

arc(m,q,7).
arc(p,q,9).
arc(p,m,5).
Graph-term form

digraph([k,m,p,q],[a(m,p,7),a(p,m,5),a(p,q,9)])
Adjacency-list form

[n(k,[]),n(m,[q/7]),n(p,[m/5,q/9]),n(q,[])]
Notice how the edge information has been packed into a term with functor '/' and arity 2, together with the corresponding node.

Human-friendly form

[p>q/9, m>q/7, k, p>m/5]
The notation for labelled graphs can also be used for so-called multi-graphs, where more than one edge (or arc) are allowed between two given nodes.

```elm
graphToAdjList g : Graph -> AdjacencyList

adjListToGraph al : AdjancencyList -> Graph

```

```
import Html exposing (text)


al = [('b',['c','f']), ('c',['b','f']), ('d',[]), ('f',['b','c','k']), ('g',['h'])]


g = ['b','c','d','f','g','h','k'],[('b','c'),('b','f'),('c','f'),('f','k'),('g','h')]


main =
    text toString (== (graphToAdjList g) (adjListToGraph al) )         
```

Result
```
True
```
