# Problem 61a

Count the leaves of a binary tree. The leaves are the nodes that have empty nodes in both their right and left subtrees.

##Example
```elm
tree = Tree 1 (Tree 2 Empty (Tree 4 Empty Empty))
                 (Tree 2 Empty Empty)

countLeaves tree == 2   
```


#Problem 61b

Extract the leaves of a binary tree into a list.

##Example
```elm
tree = Tree 1 (Tree 2 Empty (Tree 4 Empty Empty))
                 (Tree 2 Empty Empty)

getLeaves aTree == [4, 2]
```
