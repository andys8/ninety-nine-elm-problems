# Problem 23

Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a list.

##Example
```elm
seed = 123456789
randomSelect seed 3 ["Al", "Biff", "Cal", "Dee", "Ed", "Flip"] == ["Cal", "Dee", "Al"]
```

##Randomness in a pure functional world
Two plus two equals four. I can say that with confidence that it will be as true when you read those word as when I write them. The state of the universe will not influence arithmetic such that next Tuesday two plus two will equal five. 

In pure functional programming languages like Elm functions always produce the same results given the same inputs. This property is called referential transparency. The expression ```List.sum [2, 2]``` is functionally equivalent to the expression ```4```.

Imperative languages have some functions that are not referentially transparent. Here are a couple really  useful ones from C. 
``` 
   time_t result = time(NULL); 
   int r = rand();
```

Some functional programming languages are impure. This means they allow some functions to depend on state, some functions like ```time``` and ```rand``` that don't always return the same value given the same inputs. Elm, however is pure, and therefore we need to find another way to create pseudo randomness.
