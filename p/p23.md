# Problem 23

Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a list.

##Example
```elm
seed = Random.initialSeed 123456789
randomSelect 3 ["Al", "Biff", "Cal", "Dee", "Ed", "Flip"] == ["Cal", "Dee", "Al"]
```

##Randomness in a pure functional language
Two plus two equals four. The state of the universe will not influence arithmetic such that next Tuesday two plus two will equal five. 

In pure functional programming languages like Elm functions always produce the same results given the same inputs. This property is called referential transparency. The expression ```List.sum [2, 2]``` is functionally equivalent to the expression ```4```.

Imperative languages have some functions that are not referentially transparent. Here are a couple really  useful ones from C. 
``` 
   time_t t = time(NULL); 
   int r = rand();
```

Randomness, by definition, is not referentially transparent. Elm implements psuedo-randomness with the  ```Random.step``` function, which always returns the same result given the same input seed value. It also returns a new seed which can be used in the next call of ```Random.step``` to retrieve the next value in the psuedo-random sequence.
