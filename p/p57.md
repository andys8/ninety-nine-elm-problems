# Problem 57

Build a binary search tree from a list. Lower values should be placed to the right

##Example 
```elm
toTree [1, 2, 3, 0] == Node 1 
                  (Node 2 Empty (Node 3 Empty Empty)) 
                  (Node 0 Empty Empty)
```

##Unit Test
```elm
import Html
import List
import String


type Tree a
    = Empty
    | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
    

toTree : List comparable -> Tree comparable
toTree list =
    -- your implementation here
                
  
main =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )


test : Bool
test =
    List.all ((==) True)
        [ toTree [] == Empty
        , toTree [1] == Node 1 Empty Empty
        , count (toTree [1, 2, 3]) == 3
        , count (toTree [1..100]) == 100
        ]

    
-- count number of Nodes in a Tree    
count : Tree a -> Int
count tree = 
    case tree of 
        Empty -> 0
        
        Node n left right ->
            1 + (count left) + (count right)
  
  
```

##Hints
1. Problem 55 has very nearly the same solution.
