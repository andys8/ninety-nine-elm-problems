# Problem 4
Elm provides the function ```List.length```. See if you can implement it yourself.
##Example
```
countElements [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1] == 7
```
## Unit Test
```elm
import Html exposing (text)
import List
countElements : List a -> Int
countElements xs =
 -- your implementation here
 0

main =
 text
 (if (test) then
 "Your implementation passed all tests."
 else
 "Your implementation failed at least one test."
 )
test : Bool
test =
 List.all ((==) True)
 [ countElements [1..4000] == 4000
 , countElements [ 1 ] == 1
 , countElements [] == 0
 , countElements [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] == 3
 ]
```
## Hints
1. Use a fold.
2. Elm has a specialize fold, ```List.sum```. How can you transform the list such that ```List.sum``` gives you the answer?
