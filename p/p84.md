# Problem 84

Use [Prim's algorithm](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/prims_spanning_tree_algorithm.htm) to find the minimal spanning tree of a labeled graph. 

##Example
```elm
g84 = ([1,2,3,4,5], [(1,2,"12"),(1,3,"34"),(1,5,"78"),(2,4,"55"),(2,5,"32"),(3,4,"61"),(3,5,"44"),(4,5,"93")])

prim84 = ([1,2,3,4,5], [(1,2,"12"),(1,3,"34"),(2,4,"55"),(2,5,"32")] 
prim84 == prim g84 
```
##Unit Test
```elm
import Html
import List
import Set


type alias Edge comparable = (comparable, comparable)
type alias AdjList comparable = (List((comparable, List comparable)))
type alias Graph comparable = (List comparable, List (Edge comparable))


prim : Graph comparable -> Graph comparable
prim (nodes, edges) = 
    -- your implementation goes here
    ([], [])


main =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )


test : Bool
test =
    List.all ((==) True)
      [ prim84 == prim g84 
      , ([], []) == prim ([], [])
      ]


g84 = ([1,2,3,4,5], [(1,2,"12"),(1,3,"34"),(1,5,"78"),(2,4,"55"),(2,5,"32"),(3,4,"61"),(3,5,"44"),(4,5,"93")])

prim84 = ([1,2,3,4,5], [(1,2,"12"),(1,3,"34"),(2,4,"55"),(2,5,"32")] 

```
