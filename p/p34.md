# Problem 34
Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).

Euler's totient function phi(m) is defined as the number of positive integers``` r (1 <= r < m)``` that are coprime with ```m```.

##Example 
>  let m = 10   
>  then coprimes of m are 1,3,7,9   
>  and totient of m is 4

Note the special case: ```totient 1 == 1``` 

## Unit Test
```

import Html
import List


totient : Int -> Int
totient a =
    -- your implementation here
    0


main =
    Html.text
        <| case test of
            0 ->
                "Your implementation passed all tests."

            1 ->
                "Your implementation failed one test."

            n ->
                "Your implementation failed " ++ (toString n) ++ " tests."


test : Int
test =
    List.length
        <| List.filter ((==) False)
            [ totient 10 == 4
            , totient 25 == 20
            , totient 120 == 32
            , totient 0 == 0
            , totient 1600 == 64
            , totient 37 == 36
            , totient 330 == 8
            , totient 65934 == 1944
            , totient 1313 == 120
            , totient 45 == 2
            , totient -23 == 0
            ]

```
## Hints
1. Use ```coprime``` from [Problem 33](p33.md) with ```List.filter```.
