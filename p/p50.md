#Problem 50 - Huffman Encoding 
Huffman coding uses variable bit length codes to efficiently encode data. By giving the frequently found values short codes and rarely used values longer codes, it's possible to compress data. The first step in Huffman encoding is to determine the frequency of every value in the input data. 

##Example
```elm 
-- freqs : List a -> List (Int, a)
freqs [1, 20, 20, 3, 3, 3, 3] = [(1, 1), (2, 20), (4, 3)]
```
