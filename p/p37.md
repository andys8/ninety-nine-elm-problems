# Problem 37

Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).

See [problem 34](p34.md) for the definition of Euler's totient function. If the list of the prime factors of a number ```m``` is known in the form of [problem 36](p36.md) then the function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: 
```
Let ((p1 m1) (p2 m2) (p3 m3) ...) be the list of prime
factors and their multiplicities) of a given number m. 
Then phi(m) can be calculated with the following formula:

phi(m) = ((p1 - 1) * p1 ^ (m1 - 1)) * 
         ((p2 - 1) * p2 ^ (m2 - 1)) * 
         ((p3 - 1) * p3 ^ (m3 - 1)) * ...
```

coprime :  Int -> Int -> Bool

##Hints
1. Can you use the special fold ```List.product```?
