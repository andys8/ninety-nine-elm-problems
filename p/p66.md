# Problem 66

The illustration below depicts yet another layout strategy. 

![](../i/p66.gif)
The method yields a very compact layout while maintaining a certain symmetry in every node. Find out the rules and write the layout function. Hint: Consider the horizontal distance between a node and its successor nodes. How tight can you pack together two subtrees to construct the combined binary tree?

```
import Html exposing (text)

type Tree a
    = Empty
    | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

tree66 = 
    Node 'n'
        (Node 'k'
            (Node 'c'
                (Node 'a' Empty Empty)
                (Node 'e'
                    (Node 'd' Empty Empty)
                    (Node 'g' Empty Empty)))
                        (Node 'm' Empty Empty))
        (Node 'u'
            (Node 'p'
            Empty
              (Node 'q' Empty Empty))
                        Empty
                )
                
layoutTree'' : Tree a -> Tree (a, (Int, Int))
-- layoutTree'' tree =
  -- your implementation goes here

main =
  text
  <| toString
  <| layoutTree'' tree66
  
```
Result
```
Branch ('n',(5,1)) (Branch ('k',(3,2)) (Branch ('c',(2,3)) ...
```
