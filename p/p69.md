# Problem 69

Using the preorder sequence of values and dots (.) to represent empty subtrees we can unambiguously represent a binary tree. 

a) Write a function to represent a tree as a dot-string. 

b) Write a function to build a tree from a dot-string.

```
import Html exposing (text)


type Tree a
    = Empty
    | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)


tree69 = "abd..e..c.fg..."


dotToTree : String -> Tree String
dotToTree s =
  -- your implementation here


treeToDot : Tree String -> String
treeToDot s =
  -- your implementation here


main =
    text 
        <| treeToDot 
        <| dotToTree tree69
```
        
Result
```
abd..e..c.fg...
```
