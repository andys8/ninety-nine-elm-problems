# Problem 69

Using the preorder sequence of values and dots (.) to represent empty subtrees we can unambiguously represent a binary tree. 

a) Write a function to create the dot-string representation of a tree. 

b) Write a function to build a tree from a dot-string.

##Example
```
tree69 = "abd..e..c.fg..."
tree69 == treeToDot <| dotToTree tree69
```
   
##Unit Test

##Hints
1. To convert from string to tree recurse in preorder with a function that returns two values, the tree value and the unused portion of the string.
