# Problem 35
Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer. Construct a flat list containing the prime factors in ascending order.

Example:
```
primeFactors 315 == [3, 3, 5, 7]
```

## Unit Test
```elm
import Html 
import List
import Maybe


primeFactors : Int -> List Int
primeFactors n =
    -- your implementation here
    []
    
           
main =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )


test : Bool
test =
    List.all (\(result, expect) -> result == expect)
        [ ( primeFactors 36, [2, 2, 3, 3] )
          , ( primeFactors 10, [2, 5] )
          , ( primeFactors -1, [] )
          , ( primeFactors 1, [] )
          , ( primeFactors 0, [] )
          , ( primeFactors 120, [2, 2, 2, 3, 5] )
          , ( primeFactors 2, [2] )
          , ( primeFactors 23, [23] )
          , ( primeFactors 69146, [2, 7, 11, 449] )
          , ( primeFactors 9007, [9007] )
          , ( primeFactors 36028, [2, 2, 9007] )
          , ( primeFactors 26028, [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 241] )
        ]        
```

## Hints
1. Use ```primesRange``` from  [Problem 39](p39.md) to give you all the prime numbers from 2 to n, and search for factors.
2. Try to implement the solution without ```primesRange```. Instead use ```dropWhile``` from [Problem 8](problem_8_solutions.md) to filter to the factors.
