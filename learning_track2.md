# Learning Track

The problems are numbered to match the previous versions of _99 Problems_. This is not the best order to tackle the problems if you are new, or new-ish to functional programming. The Learning Track presents a order designed to learn functional programming in a sequence that builds from the most basic idioms to more complex. Each section presents a new technique and problems that you can solve with that technique. The problems let you develop experience before moving on to the next concept.

* Simple List functions
* Recursion
* Recursion on Lists
* Folding
* Maybe, Just, Nothing

Note the Learning Track does not include all of the 99 problem, and sometimes repeats a problem so you can solve it a different way. For example you will solve Problem 4, `countElements`, three different times, with three different approaches.
