# Lists

Lists and functional programming go together like a horse and carriage.

[Problem 1](/../p/p01.md) - Get last element of a list.

Problem 2 - Get penultimate element of a list.

Problem 3 - Get the element of a list at a specified index.

Problem 4 - Get the count of elements in a list.

Problem 5 - Reverse a list.

Problem 6 - Determine if a list is a palindrome.

Problem 8 - Eliminate consecutive duplicate elements from a list.

Problem 9 - Place consecutive duplicate elements of a list into a list of lists.

# List Extras

Many of the solutions to problems in this book can take advantage of some commonly used list manipulation functions. The Elm community created the [List.Extra](https://github.com/elm-community/list-extra) module which is well worth your time to peruse. These functions will be familiar to experienced functional programmers, especially Haskell programmers.

Since List.Extra is not part of the Elm core we won't use the module in this book. However some of the functions are inescapably useful. So let's add a few extra problems to the original 99, so we can use them in later solutions.
