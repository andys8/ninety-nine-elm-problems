#Recursion
A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it arrives at the solution.

##Problem 32

 Euclid's algorithm recurses to find the greatest common denominator of two numbers using the following steps:

1. Given two numbers, a and b divide a by b
2. If the remainder of the division is 0, the numerator is the gcd.
3. else divide the demoninator by the remainder and return to step 2.

Use recursion to solve [Problem 32](../p/p32.md).
