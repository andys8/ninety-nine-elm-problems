#Recursion

##Problem 32

A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it arrives at the solution. Euclid's algorithm recurses to find the greatest common denominator of two numbers using the following steps:

1. Given two numbers, a and b divide a by b
2. If the remainder of the division is 0, the numerator is the gcd.
3. else divide the demoninator by the remainder and return to step 2.

Use recursion to solve [Problem 32](../p/p32.md).

##Binary Tree traversal

Use recursion to traverse a binary tree.
1. [Problem 61a](p/p61a.md) - Count leaf nodes of a binary tree.
2. [Problem 61b](p/p61b.md) - Get leaf node values from a binary tree.
3. [Problem 62a](p/p62a.md) - Count internal nodes. 
4. [Problem 62b](p/p62b.md) - Get internal node values.
