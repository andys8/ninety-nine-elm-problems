#Recursion
A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it arrives at the solution.

##Problems to solve with recursion

[Problem 32](../p/p32.md) - Use recursion to implement Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common denominator of two numbers.

[Problem 31](p/p31.md) - Use ```List.filter``` to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
