# Simple List functions

Let's learn some basic functions from the `List` module.

## Problems to solve using simple List functions

[Problem 6](../p/p06.md) - Use ```List.reverse``` to test if a list is a palindrome. 

[Problem 17](../p/p17.md) - Use `List.take` and `List.drop` to split a list into two lists.

[Problem 18](../p/p18.md) - Use `List.take` and `List.drop` to take a portion of a list

[Problem 20](../p/p20.md) - Use `List.take` and `List.drop` and the append operator ```(++)``` or ```List.append``` to remove an element from a list. 

[Problem 19](../p/p19.md) - Use `List.take` and `List.drop` and the append operator ```(++)``` or ```List.append``` to rotate the elements of a list. 

[Problem 21](../p/p21.md)  Use `List.take`, `List.drop`, append operator ```(++)``` and the "cons" operator ```(::)``` to get a specified element from a list. You may want to use split from [Problem 17](../p/p17.md).

[Extra 1](../p/e01.md) - [Pass a function](/passing_functions.md) to remove some elements from the front of a list.
