# List Extras

Many of the solutions to problems in this book can take advantage of some commonly used list manipulation functions. The Elm community created the [List.Extra](https://github.com/elm-community/list-extra) module which is well worth your time to peruse. These functions will be familiar to experienced functional programmers, especially Haskell programmers.

Since `List.Extra` is not part of the Elm core we won't use the module in this book. However some of the functions are inescapably useful. So let's add a few extra problems to the original 99, so we can use them in later solutions.
