# Problem 21 Solutions
## Solution 1
Use split from [Problem 17](problem_17_solutions.md).

```
split : List a -> Int -> (List a, List a)
split list count =
    (List.take count list, List.drop count list)
    
    
insertAt : List a -> Int -> a -> List a
insertAt n v xs =
    let 
      (front, back) = split xs (n - 1)
    in
      front ++ (v :: back)
```      
      
## Solution 2
Do the split internally with List.drop and List.take
```
insertAt : List a -> Int -> a -> List a
insertAt n v xs =
    List.take (n-1) xs ++ ( v :: List.drop (n-1) xs)
```

## Solution 3
Is there anything you can't do with recursion?

```
insertAt : List a -> Int -> a -> List a
insertAt n v xs =
  if n < 2 then
    v :: xs
  else 
    case xs of
      [] -> 
        [v]
    
      y :: ys ->
        y :: insertAt ys (n - 1) v
```
