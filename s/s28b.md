# Problem 28.b Solution

1. Create a table of list lengths, and their frequencies (see ```lenFreq```). 
2. Use that table to sort the list. Note the partial application of the table to the comparison function``` sortLenFreq```.


```elm
sortByLengthFrequency : List (List a) -> List (List a)
sortByLengthFrequency xs =
    let
        lenFreqs =
            lenFreq xs
    in
        List.sortBy (sortLenFreq lenFreqs) xs


sortLenFreq : List ( Int, Int ) -> List a -> Int
sortLenFreq lenFreqs xs =
    let
        len =
            List.length xs

        tl =
            dropWhile (\( l, f ) -> l /= len) lenFreqs
    in
        snd <| Maybe.withDefault ( 0, 0 ) <| List.head tl


lenFreq : List (List a) -> List ( Int, Int )
lenFreq xs =
    case xs of
        [] ->
            [ ( 0, 0 ) ]

        l :: ls ->
            let
                len =
                    List.length l

                ( l1, l2 ) =
                    List.partition (\x -> List.length x == len) xs

                freq =
                    List.length l1
            in
                if List.isEmpty l2 then
                    [ ( len, freq ) ]
                else
                    ( len, freq ) :: lenFreq l2


dropWhile : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
dropWhile predicate list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            []

        x :: xs ->
            if (predicate x) then
                dropWhile predicate xs
            else
                list
              
```
