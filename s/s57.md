# Problem 57 Solutions

###Solution 1
Add one node at a time.

```elm

toBSTree : List comparable -> Tree comparable
toBSTree list =
    case list of
        [] -> 
            Empty 
        
        _ -> 
            List.foldl addBSNode Empty list
    
    
addBSNode : comparable -> Tree comparable -> Tree comparable
addBSNode v tree =
    case tree of
        Empty ->
            Node v Empty Empty
            
        Node v' left right ->
            if v < v' then
                Node v' left (addBSNode v right) 
            else 
                Node v' (addBSNode v left) right 
                          
```

###Solution 2
A more efficient solution could add many nodes at once.
