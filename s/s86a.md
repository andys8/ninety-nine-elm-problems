# Problem 86a Solution

```elm
{-| Given a graph return a graph with the degree of each node correctly set
   so we can color the graph with the minimum number of colors
-}
degree : Graph comparable -> Graph comparable
degree ( nodes, edges ) =
    let
        endPoints =
            List.concatMap (\( a, b, w ) -> [ a, b ]) edges

        nodes' =
            List.map (\( n, d, c ) -> ( n, (countMembers n endPoints), c )) nodes
    in
        ( nodes', edges )


countMembers : a -> List a -> Int
countMembers value list =
    List.length <| List.filter ((==) value) list

```
