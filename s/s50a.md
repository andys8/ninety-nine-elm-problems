#Problem 50a Solutions

###Solution 1
Sort the input, then use the ```pack``` function from [Problem 9](../p/p09.md), ```runLengths``` from [Problem 10](../p/p10.md). Note this requires that the type of the input be a ```comparable```. 

```elm
freqs : List comparable -> List ( Int, comparable )
freqs list =
    runLengths <| pack <| List.sort list


pack : List a -> List (List a)
pack xs =
    case xs of
        [] ->
            []

        y :: ys ->
            pack' y [ y ] ys


pack' : a -> List a -> List a -> List (List a)
pack' v run xs =
    case xs of
        [] ->
            [ run ]

        y :: ys ->
            if y == v then
                pack' y (y :: run) ys
            else
                (run) :: pack' y [ y ] ys


runLengths : List (List a) -> List ( Int, a )
runLengths xss =
    List.map (\xs -> ( List.length xs, List.head xs )) xss |> removeNothings


removeNothings : List ( Int, Maybe a ) -> List ( Int, a )
removeNothings xs =
    case xs of
        [] ->
            []

        ( c, Nothing ) :: ys ->
            removeNothings ys

        ( c, Just y ) :: ys ->
            ( c, y ) :: removeNothings ys

```
