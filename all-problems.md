# All Problems
All problems presented in the same order as [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/). Problems which don't apply to statically typed languages are omitted. A few Extras whose solutions are useful in solving later larger problems are injected.
