# Notes on
## Collaborators
If you're interested in collaborating on the book, contact John at john.crane@gmail.com.
## Current status
* Problems 23-27 need solutions. 
* Problem 41-99 need solutions. 
## Suggested improvements
* Add functions to convert Strings to lists of character and vice versa, to make the problems more consistent with the Haskell, Lisp and Prolog predecessors.
* explain backtracking
* add to first page of sections, as done in Graphs, for example
Other stuff to do
P18 - can sublist be simplified to not use max, min, length?
P5 - write a recursive version
 rev = rev xs ++ [x]
p14 - duplicate that uses fold
Add problem alpha for dropWhile before P8
add problem beta takeWhile before P9
