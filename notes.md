## Current status
* Problems 27 (disjoint sets) needs a solution. 
* Problems 48 (Truth tables) need solution.
* Problem 56 (Symmetric binary tree) needs solution. 
* Problem 61b, should change ```comparable``` to ```a``` by having a smarter test function.
* Problem 64 (layout tree in grid)- Solution 2 is in Haskell only, needs to be translated to Elm. 
* Problem 65 (layout tree in grid) needs a solution
* Problem 67b needs a solution
* In Problem 41 the two solutions don't agree. Why? Is either correct?
* Skipped Problems 69, 70
* Problem 84, 86 should remove loops and parallel edges

## Omitted problems
* Omitted 58, 59, 60, 89 for complexity and lack of value
* Omitted Problem 66 for complexity and similarity to other problems
* Omitted 25 because it is identical to 23

## Suggested additions
* elm-format code
* * Five implementations of List.length
* add to first page of sections, as done in Graphs, for example
* P18 - can sublist be simplified to not use max, min, length?
* P5 - write a recursive version
 rev = rev xs ++ [x]
* p14 - duplicate that uses fold
*
