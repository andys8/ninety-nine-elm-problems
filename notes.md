# Notes 


## Possible improvements
* *
* Five implementations of List.length
* Find problems that should use Result
* Add to Learning 
* * passing functions as arguments (List.sort, List.filter)
* * concatMap
* Review category pages
* Add a *Lost Problems* page

## Omitted problems
* Omitted 58, 59, 60, 89 for complexity and lack of value
* Omitted Problem 66 for complexity and similarity 64 and 65
* Omitted 25 because it is identical to 23
* Omitted 27 - disjoint sets
* Omitted 82, very similar to 87b
* Omitted 83, 85
* Omitted 48 - variably sized truth tables 
* Omitted 67b - de-lispify tree
* Puzzle problems (90-99) do not have solutions
