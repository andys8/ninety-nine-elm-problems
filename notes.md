## Current status
* Problems 27 (disjoint sets) needs a solution. 
* Problems 48 (Truth tables) need solution.
* Problem 56 (Symmetric binary tree) needs solution. 
* Problem 61b, should change ```comparable``` to ```a``` by having a smarter test function.
* Problem 64 - Solution 2 is in Haskell only, needs to be translated to Elm. 
* Problem 65, 66 need a solution
* Problem 67b needs a solution
* In Problem 41 the two solutions don't agree. Why? Is either correct?
* Skipped Problems 69, 70

## Omitted problems
* Omitted 58, 59, 60 for complexity and lack of value
* Removed 25 because it is identical to 23

## Suggested additions
* Add extras for Binary Trees
 * Search binary tree
* Add Glossary
* add to first page of sections, as done in Graphs, for example
Other stuff to do
P18 - can sublist be simplified to not use max, min, length?
P5 - write a recursive version
 rev = rev xs ++ [x]
p14 - duplicate that uses fold
