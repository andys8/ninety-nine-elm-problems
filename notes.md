# Notes 

## Collaborators
If you're interested in collaborating on the book place note on the discussion board or contact John at john.crane@gmail.com.

## Current status
* Problem 9 can have more solutions, using fold - see [H-99](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/Solutions/9) 
* Problems 23, 24, 27, 41, 48, 50b, 56 need solutions. 
* Problems 55, 57 can have a more efficient solution.
* Problem 61b, should change ```comparable``` to ```a``` by having a smarter test function.
* Omitted 58, 59, 60 for complexity and lack of value
* Problem 64 - Solution 2 is in Haskell only, needs to be translated to Elm. 
* Problem 65, 66 need a solution
* Problem 67b needs a solution
* Skipped Problems 69, 70

## Suggested improvements
* Add extras for Binary Trees
 * Search binary tree
 * Search binary search tree
 * toList PreOder, InOrder, PostOrder  
* Add functions to convert Strings to lists of character and vice versa, to make the problems more consistent with the Haskell, Lisp and Prolog predecessors.
* Add Glossary
* add to first page of sections, as done in Graphs, for example
Other stuff to do
P18 - can sublist be simplified to not use max, min, length?
P5 - write a recursive version
 rev = rev xs ++ [x]
p14 - duplicate that uses fold
Add problem alpha for dropWhile before P8
add problem beta takeWhile before P9
