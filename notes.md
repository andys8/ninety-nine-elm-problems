# Notes 

## Problems still to be done
* Find cyclic paths in graph - 82

## Omitted problems
* Omitted 58, 59, 60, 89 for complexity and lack of value
* Omitted Problem 66 for complexity and similarity 64 and 65
* Omitted 25 because it is identical to 23
* Puzzle problems (90-99) do not have solutions
* Omitted 27 - disjoint sets
* Omitted 82, very similar to 87b
* Omitted 48 - variably sized truth tables 
* Omitted 67b - de-lispify tree

## Other improvements
* elm-format code
* Five implementations of List.length
* * review simple problems to see if alternate solutions can use any of the other patterns.
* Search solutions to categorize for leaning track
* * Add concatMap to learning track
* Review category pages
* Add a *Lost Problems* page
