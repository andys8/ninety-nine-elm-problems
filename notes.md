## Problems still to be done
* Find cyclic paths in graph - 82
* Depth first traversal of tree - 87
* Find connected graphs - 88 
* Problem 56 (Symmetric binary tree) needs solution. 
* Problems 27 (disjoint sets) needs a solution. 
* Problems 48 (Truth tables) need solution.
* Problem 65 (layout tree in grid) needs a solution
* Problem 67b (de-lispify tree) needs a solution

## Improvement to solutions
* Problem 64 (layout tree in grid)- Solution 2 is in Haskell only, needs to be translated to Elm. 
* In Problem 41 the two solutions don't agree. Why? Is either correct?
* Problem 84, 86 should remove loops and parallel edges
* P5 - write a recursive version
 rev = rev xs ++ [x]
* p14 - duplicate, more solutions 
* * solution that uses fold
* * [x,x] ++ (duplicate xs)
* * solution using concatMap

## Omitted problems
* Omitted 58, 59, 60, 89 for complexity and lack of value
* Omitted Problem 66 for complexity and similarity 64 and 65
* Omitted 25 because it is identical to 23

## Other improvements
* elm-format code
* Five implementations of List.length
* * review simple problems to see if alternate solutions can use any of the other patterns.
* Search solutions to categorize for leaning track
* Review category pages
* Add concatMap to learning page
